### **How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?**

In order to maintain maintainable, readable, and adaptable code, it was important for me to test my code frequently. When I get into good testing habits, it allows me to debug more efficiently and find and fix issues easier. Also, commenting my code is crucial to allow users who may not be familiar with the project to understand what each piece of code does. Having a seperate CRUD file also helped keep my code organized, and I intend to use this strategy in the future. 

### **How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?**

When I'm faced with a project or application that I need to approach, I typically break the assignment up into pieces. Dividing a large project into smaller components allows me to maintain good code, as well as lets me easily organize and debug. If I try and solve too many problems at once, I find myself losing track of progress and getting lost within my own code easily. 

### **What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?**

Computer scientists help build applications that (hopefully) solve real world issues. The work I did for my final project was a great example of how a C.S. can help a company accomplish a goal, and make their application come to life.
